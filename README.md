# My Notebook
This is one place I store all my great ideas for software tools as short notes.

## What is the purpose of this repository?
Let's say I don't know how to code something, it would take too much time, or I couldn't do it by myself. This allows me to still document what software I'm imagining and show them to everyone too!

## Where is everything?
The [list.md](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/blob/main/list.md) file shows all of the software ideas that I've noted down, and links to equivalent software if my dreams come true, helping others find cool things in the process. If I don't know of any software that sounds like the note I made, I'll reference an issue asking for it.

## Can I help out?
Of course! If you know of existing software for one of my ideas, reply to the issue referencing the idea. I'll plan to take a look at it, review it, and add it to the list!

However, these notes are really designed to be my notes, my choices, not a community-curated list. But you can point out errors (typos, incorrect links) for me if you find anything or even suggest changes to the repository structure (like the configurations).

## I want those too, can I spread the word?
You're welcome to tell others about any ideas I noted down here if you want. Maybe someone would like an idea so much that they recreate it!
