# My Notebook
This is one place I store all my great ideas for software tools as concise notes.

## What is the purpose of this repository?
Let's say I don't know how to code something, it would take too much time, or I couldn't do it by myself. This allows me to still document what software I'm imagining and show them to everyone!

## Where is everything?
The [list.md](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/blob/main/list.md) file shows links to all of the software ideas that I've noted down, and links to them if my dreams come true. If I don't know of any software that sounds like the note I made, I just reference an issue asking for it.

## Can I help you?
Of course! If you have recreated or know of software for one of my ideas, reply to the issue referencing the idea and I'll take a look at it and add it to the list!

These notes aren't really designed for the community to add on to or collaborate on as they're my notes, my choices, but you can point out errors (typos, incorrect links) for me if you find anything or even suggest changes to the repository structure (like the settings).

## Can I share your ideas elsewhere?
Sure. I license my notes under a [CC0 license](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/blob/main/LICENSE), so they're in the public domain, baby!
