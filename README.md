# My Software Concept Notebook
**If I ever make software, I'd love if I could create...**
- An automated backup tool
- A tool that counts your notifications
- and [more](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/blob/main/list.md)

This is a place I note and share some of the kinds of apps and tools I've been wanting. The list is [**right here**](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/blob/main/list.md).

## What is the purpose of this repository?
When I don't know how to code something yet or it would take too much time, this repository allows me to still document what software I'm imagining (and show them to everyone else, too)!

## Where is everything?
- The [**list.md**](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/blob/main/list.md) file shows the software ideas I wanted to share. It may also contain links to equivalent software if my dreams come true, helping others find cool tools in the process.
- If I don't know of any software that sounds like the note I made, I'll open an [**issue**](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/issues) asking for it.
- If software that's basically that idea is found, a [**pull request**](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/pulls) will update the list to reference it. (The [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) can help you with this.)

## I think I found the software for you.
While I'm in charge of this wish list, you can help out if you know of existing software for one of my ideas. You can create a fork and a pull request replacing the link to an issue with a link to the software you found in order to request it to be added. I hope to take a look at it, review it, and add it to the list! Need help? Give the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) a read.

Again, this repository is really designed to be a notebook for myself and not a community-curated list, but you can point out errors (typos, incorrect links) for me if you find anything or even suggest changes to the other repository files (like the README).

## I want that software too, can I spread the word?
If you want, you're welcome to tell others about any ideas I noted down, as they are or with your own take on them. Maybe someone would like an idea so much that they recreate it (which is what I want)!
