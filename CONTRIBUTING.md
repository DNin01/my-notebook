## Adding links to software

If you know of existing software for one of my ideas, you can help me by creating a link under an idea so it links to software that is at least the idea I came up with.

New to contributing? Great news! It's not hard at all, especially when you're using the web UI. Here's exactly what you need to do to make a pull request using the web UI:

1. [Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository). Or, if you already have a fork, sync the "main" branch using [the `Sync fork` option](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-18605/images/help/repository/sync-fork-dropdown.png) so everything is up to date!
2. I highly recommend you [create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository#creating-a-branch). This makes sure that you can easily create new changes without making new forks or resetting things. When you make your new branch, the files from the "main" branch will automatically copy into it!
3. Open the list.md file (and make sure you're in your new branch), click the ‚úè button, and make your change. On whatever idea that you found software for, replace the link to the issue (should look something like `[Found software for this?](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/issues/1)`) with a link to the software. This should be styled like `[Software available](<url>)`. Example: `[Software available](https://github.com/microsoft/calculator)`. That's all you need to do.
4. At the bottom of the page, click "Commit changes" to save the file.
5. [Make a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to propose the edit.

You don't have to install any software to do this. But of course, you can always use Git instead if you know how to do that.

Done? Congratulations! After I review the software you linked, it'll be referenced in the list, all thanks to you! Plus, I'll have another tool to enjoy.

### Tips

- It's a good idea to [check for PRs](https://github.com/DNin01/my-notebook/pulls) that link the same software. That way, you know if someone already requested software to be added, and if there happens to be one already, you don't need to make a duplicate PR.
- Make sure the software is appropriate for the idea and covers all the points I wanted. If I write a note specifically mentioning a graphing feature for a calculator app, then I'm not asking for a calculator _without_ a graphing mode. However, if I say that _maybe_ a graphing mode would be cool, it's okay if you can't find a calculator app with that feature.
- Only add one link per PR. If I have to add a bunch of software at once, they'll all have to be reviewed, which would prolong the review time for your PR. Plus, if one software link is rejected, the entire PR may have to be rejected until you make a change. You can always make multiple PRs each with a single change.
- I'd like if the software you're telling me about has a repository on GitHub and you link to it, even if there is an official website. That way, the software references don't go off-site. If you can't find a GitHub repository or the software is closed-source, link to the official software homepage or preferably to a store page, and please indicate that with the following: `[Software available on <store/website name>](<store/home page url>)`. Example: `[Software available on Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFHVN5)`
- Be patient - your PR won't be merged right away (in other words, your changes won't be applied to the base repository immediately), and depending on the complexity of the software and how many other PRs are coming in, it might take a lot of time to review. Just hang in there while it's checked for quality and safety. Also, at the moment, I'm the only maintainer. I want to collaborate eventually, but I'll try my best to ensure the quality and safety of the software that's linked.

It's also okay to request to change the links to software occasionally. You might want to do this if there is software with more of the might-be-cool features I've mentioned, or it's more powerful while still being about as intuitive.

## Making other changes

Feel free to propose changes to some of the general repository files (like the contributing guidelines, in case of a typo) or anything else!

<sup>(If you missed it, the steps to make a pull request are above)</sup>

Error corrections (like fixes to any typos or incorrect information) are welcome, but I do recommend you keep in mind the list format and the fact that _I'm_ writing the notes. I can't always change everything in the repository without it causing conflicts on pending PRs, so depending on the change I make, it might not work out. And this particular list is meant to be _my_ collection of ideas, not a community curation. But... for anyone who wants to make their own lists, it might be worth checking out or making an [awesome list](https://github.com/topics/awesome).

## Submitting issues

If you don't feel like going through the process of creating a pull request, you can always use issues to send feedback and suggestions for other repository files.

You can also mention software you found by commenting on the issue asking for it (for instance, if I noted down some ideas for a particular kind of app and I don't know of any apps that do the same things, you can write a comment and mention an app with the feature ideas I wrote down). I'll be happy to add it to the list for you.
