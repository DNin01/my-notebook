# Security Policy

## Reporting security vulnerabilties in software on this list

If the software from a repository on this list has a security vulnerability or bug, **follow that repository's security policy to report the bug to its repository maintainers/organization members.**

## Reporting unsafe software

While checking out software is great, the world of software isn't all flowers and roses.

If it turns out that malicious software slipped into the list, **make an issue to bring it to my attention.** It's important that if someone has happened to install malware, they know about the situation. Malware isn't a bug to be "fixed", so you are allowed to publicly state any software on the list that you find is malicious. If it turns out to be malicious, it'll be removed from the list and I'll publish a security advisory to let everyone know.

If you download software from the list and would like to be notified about unsafe software, click Watch, choose Custom, and select Security advisories. Now, GitHub will notify you when I publish an advisory for unsafe software.
