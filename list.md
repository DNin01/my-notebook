# List of notes

### Autocorrect browser extension
A lightweight browser extension that auto-corrects what you type _without touching anything_. There could also be additional features like using a Find feature to replace certain letters or words with something different, creating automatic text replacements (like expanding "omw" to "on my way"), or saving phrases for quick reuse later.

### Folder backup desktop program
A desktop program that allows you to choose particular folders to regularly copy to a second hard drive to back them up.

<sup>Note: I know similar programs exist, but I want something simple and that backs up to a local hard drive. And Windows File History only lets me choose top-level folders from my user account (like Documents), while I want it to be more specific to start. Something like that or MacOS's Time Machine might be cool, as long as it lets me choose exactly what I want to back up.</sup>

### Image hider browser extension
A browser extension that makes images you choose invisible. Maybe you want to hide a distracting GIF or background picture. Maybe you could also choose to neutralize (pause) GIFs by default.

<sup>Note: there are some browser extensions that allow you to block images, but they're still relying on something from manifest version 2, which will be deprecated in Chrome in 2023 [(learn more here)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/mv2-sunset/). Ideally, the software I'm looking for should be using [manifest version 3](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/blob/c2439aa243222d1fcb50806a2e92776b9066a0f4/examples/hello-world/manifest.json#L4) and just make the images invisible, not actually _block_ the images.</sup>

### Notification total browser extension
Shows you if you have notifications on websites you specify so you don't have to check each site separately. If you have a notification on a site you added, it would be cool if it could display a badge with either how many total notifications you received or how many sites you received notifications from (that would be an option).
