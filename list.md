# List of notes

### Autocorrect browser extension
A lightweight browser extension to autocorrect what you type _without touching anything_. There could also be additional features like using a Find feature to replace certain letters or words with something different, creating automatic text replacements (like expanding "omw" to "on my way"), or saving phrases for quick reuse later.
